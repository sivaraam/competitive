### Helpful point

> For prep i used 3 paid resources.
>
> - Coding ninjas (Started here, and i would still start here, considering the 24*7 doubt support )
> - Algoexpert ( Good question set)
> - LC Premium (Used for assessments)
>
> See also [buildyourownx GitHub profile](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x) which is great.

#### By Davis

> - I used educative.io for system design, and then random videos
>
>   https://neetcode.io/roadmap - This for DSA
>
> - I took some notes while I did it.
>   https://github.com/CatalanCabbage/notes/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#concepts
>
>   Go through these topics, you'll have all the lego blocks
>   Then "hld and lld for xyz" videos will show you how to put the blocks together
>
> - That way you'll be able to explain an overall system and then go into depth when they focus on a specific component as well

### Helpful advice about changing lifestyle

A good twitter thread that deeply resonates with me: [Akshaya Sivaraman on Twitter: "How did I go from a busily scheduled life to one with substantial unstructured time?](https://twitter.com/AksUnik/status/1373654933463920645 )

## Misc. notes

### Hashtable / HashMap

- _Initial capacity and load factor_ affect the performance of hash table / map.
- It is *open*: in the case of a "hash collision", a single bucket stores multiple entries.
- Iterators returned by "collection view methods" are *fail-fast*: i.e., they throw `ConcurrentModificationException` if they detect a concurrent modification of the underlying hashtable. This is *<u>not</u> fool-proof / guaranteed*. So, implementations should not depend on the same.
- Hashtable is *synchronized*. HashMap is not. For thread safe usage, a *ConcurrentHashMap* is recommended.

### Solving algorithmic problems

#### 7 Steps to Solve Algorithm Problems

1. **Listen** - Listen carefully to the problem. *Every detail* is necessary to solve that problem.
2. **Example** - Come up with a good example. Make examples larger and avoid special cases.
3. **Come up with a brute-force algorithm** - It's better to start off with a slow and terrible algorithm than to start of with nothing at all. Don't code the brute-force algorithm. Just state the brute-force algorithm and it's runtime and then go into optimizing it.
4. **Optimize**
5. **Walk through your algorithm** - *Don't code prematurely*. Take a step back and verify that the algorithm is correct.
6. **Start coding** - For whiteboard: write the line straight, use space wisely; Whiteboard or computer: coding style matters, *consistent
   coding style*, naming is important for good style (ask the interviewer if you could abbreviate them the next time), *MODULARIZE*
7. **Start testing** - analyse, double check things that look weird/risky, small test first, special cases next and if time permits large test cases. *Remember*: Think as you test. Don't go through the code like a bot. Test your code and not the algorithm!. When you find a bug, don't panic! Give some thought about fixing the bug.

#### 3 techniques to solving algorithm problems

1. B.U.D - Bottleneck, Unnecessary, Duplicates - walk through the brute force (to identity bottlenecks, unnecessary and duplicated code)
2. Space-time tradeoffs - you can almost always save some time by trading off some space. Think about Hash tables. 
3. Do it yourself - use a large generic example and try to solve it yourself. You'll identify some nice ways to optimize when solving the problem for a large test case.

## Activity log

- **18/Sep/2024** - Continue working on the optimal solution for the Two sum problem.
- **17/Sep/2024** - Worked on the [Two sum problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/). Completed the brute-force solution. Was working on optimizing the solution and was reading up on HashMap / HashTable a bit.
