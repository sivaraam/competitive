This is a note of the various things related to competitive programming / doing interviews that I've gathered so far.

### Helpful point

> For prep i used 3 paid resources.
>
> - Coding ninjas (Started here, and i would still start here, considering the 24*7 doubt support )
> - Algoexpert ( Good question set)
> - LC Premium (Used for assessments)
>
> See also [buildyourownx GitHub profile](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x) which is great.

### Helpful advice about changing lifestyle

A good twitter thread that deeply resonates with me: [Akshaya Sivaraman on Twitter: "How did I go from a busily scheduled life to one with substantial unstructured time?](https://twitter.com/AksUnik/status/1373654933463920645 )

### Solving algorithmic problems

#### 7 Steps to Solve Algorithm Problems

1. **Listen** - Listen carefully to the problem. *Every detail* is necessary to solve that problem.
2. **Example** - Come up with a good example. Make examples larger and avoid special cases.
3. **Come up with a brute-force algorithm** - It's better to start off with a slow and terrible algorithm than to start of with nothing at all. Don't code the brute-force algorithm. Just state the brute-force algorithm and it's runtime and then go into optimizing it.
4. **Optimize**
5. **Walk through your algorithm** - *Don't code prematurely*. Take a step back and verify that the algorithm is correct.
6. **Start coding** - For whiteboard: write the line straight, use space wisely; Whiteboard or computer: coding style matters, *consistent
   coding style*, naming is important for good style (ask the interviewer if you could abbreviate them the next time), *MODULARIZE*
7. **Start testing** - analyse, double check things that look weird/risky, small test first, special cases next and if time permits large test cases. *Remember*: Think as you test. Don't go through the code like a bot. Test your code and not the algorithm!. When you find a bug, don't panic! Give some thought about fixing the bug.

#### 3 techniques to solving algorithm problems

1. B.U.D - Bottleneck, Unnecessary, Duplicates - walk through the brute force (to identity bottlenecks, unnecessary and duplicated code)
2. Space-time tradeoffs - you can almost always save some time by trading off some space. Think about Hash tables. 
3. Do it yourself - use a large generic example and try to solve it yourself. You'll identify some nice ways to optimize when solving the problem for a large test case.
