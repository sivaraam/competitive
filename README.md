# Competitive Programming

A repository containing some solutions to problems from competitive programming
platforms such as [Codechef][1] and [HackerRank][2]. Also available in
the respective folders are the problem statements in the form of a PDF file.
There might also be some sample input files.

## Building
Most of the programs should be standalone so Makefile's aren't written for them.

### C++
`g++ solution.cpp`

The programs work well with a compiler that supports
C++14. It has been tested using a `g++` version 7.4.0-1ubuntu1~18.04.

### Java
`javac Solution.java`

The program works well with a OpenJDK 8 Environment.

```
$ javac -version
javac 1.8.0_212

$ java -version
openjdk version "1.8.0_212"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_212-8u212-b03-0ubuntu1.18.04.1-b03)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.212-b03, mixed mode)
```
