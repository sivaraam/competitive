## Record Linkage

This is a program that aims to solve the record linkage problem. The full
problem statement is present in the form of a PDF file. The input files 
are available in the ZIP file. The key to those files lives in our vault.

### Run the program

The following command could be used to build and run the program on a
terminal:

```shell
./gradlew build && java -jar ./build/libs/record_linkage-1.0-SNAPSHOT-all.jar
```

Input: ./src/main/resources/input1.csv
